### **Phase 2: Development Planning & Architecture**

#### Issues Encountered:
1. **Subagent Coordination Problems**
   - Multiple subagents created inconsistent implementations
   - No central coordination of technical decisions
   - Schema mismatches between frontend assumptions and backend reality

2. **Missing Integration Planning**
   - Frontend built with assumptions about backend API
   - No early validation of data flow end-to-end
   - Routes functionality assumed to exist but was incomplete

3. **Environment Configuration Chaos**
   - `.env` vs `.env.local` confusion
   - Development vs production URL mixups
   - Missing systematic environment management

#### **Learnings & Prevention Strategies:**

**üèóÔ∏è Improved Development Planning:**

1. **Single-Agent Architecture Phase**
   ```markdown
   # Architecture Design (Single Agent)
   1. Define complete data schema first
   2. Design API contracts before implementation
   3. Create environment configuration strategy
   4. Validate all assumptions with actual backend testing
   ```

2. **Integration-First Development**
   ```markdown
   # Development Order
   1. Backend schema + basic CRUD functions
   2. Test backend functions with sample data
   3. Frontend hooks connecting to real backend
   4. UI components using real data
   5. End-to-end workflow validation
   ```

3. **Environment Management Protocol**
   ```markdown
   # Environment Strategy
   - Single source of truth for environment config
   - Clear naming: .env.development, .env.production
   - Validation scripts to check environment consistency
   - Document which environment is active at each phase
   ```

---

### **Phase 3: Implementation & Development**

#### Issues Encountered:
1. **Mock vs Real Data Confusion**
   - Frontend initially showed "New Project 1751569..." instead of real data
   - Backend connectivity issues masked by loading states
   - Missing validation that data flow actually worked

2. **Schema Assumptions vs Reality**
   - Routes `useRoutes` hook assumed wrong API signature
   - Frontend expected `listByDataset` but backend had `listByProject`
   - Capacity field expected array but passed as number

3. **Missing Incremental Validation**
   - Full UI built before testing backend connectivity
   - No systematic testing of each API endpoint
   - Integration issues discovered very late

#### **Learnings & Prevention Strategies:**

**‚ö° Implementation Best Practices:**

1. **Data-First Development**
   ```markdown
   # Implementation Order
   1. Create backend schema
   2. Deploy backend functions
   3. Test each function with Convex CLI
   4. Create sample data via CLI
   5. Build frontend hooks
   6. Test hooks with real data
   7. Build UI components
   ```

2. **Incremental Integration Testing**
   ```markdown
   # Validation Checkpoints
   - [ ] Backend functions deployed and callable
   - [ ] Sample data created and accessible
   - [ ] Frontend hooks return real data
   - [ ] UI components display real data
   - [ ] Complete user workflow functional
   ```

3. **Schema Validation Protocol**
   ```markdown
   # Schema Consistency Checks
   - Generate TypeScript types from backend schema
   - Validate frontend hooks match backend function signatures
   - Test all CRUD operations before building UI
   - Document API contracts explicitly
   ```

2. **Insufficient End-to-End Testing**
   - Code compiled without errors but core functionality broken
   - TypeScript validation passed but runtime errors present
   - Missing systematic user journey validation

3. **Validation Order Problems**
   - QA validation happened after implementation instead of during
   - No early detection of requirement gaps
   - Missing continuous validation throughout development

#### **Learnings & Prevention Strategies:**

**üîç Enhanced QA Strategy:**

1. **Continuous Validation Protocol**
   ```markdown
   # QA Checkpoints (Every Development Phase)
   
   After Backend Development:
   - [ ] All API functions callable via CLI
   - [ ] Sample data created successfully
   - [ ] Schema matches frontend expectations
   
   After Frontend Hooks:

   2. Navigate: Projects ‚Üí Scenarios ‚Üí Datasets ‚Üí Tables
   3. Edit data in table editor
   4. Verify real-time updates
   5. Test on mobile devices
   ```

3. **Early Issue Detection**
   ```markdown
   # Red Flag Indicators
   - Mock data still showing instead of real data
   - Console errors during normal operation
   - Loading states that never resolve
   - Navigation links that don't work
   - TypeScript errors (even if build succeeds)
