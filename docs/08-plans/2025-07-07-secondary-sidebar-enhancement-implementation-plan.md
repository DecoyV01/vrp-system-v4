## Technical Standards

### Design System Compliance
- **Typography:** 4 sizes (text-sm, text-base, text-lg, text-xl), 2 weights (font-normal, font-semibold)
- **Spacing:** 8pt grid system (p-4, p-6, p-8, m-2, m-4, m-6, gap-2, gap-4, gap-8)
- **Colors:** 60/30/10 rule (bg-background, text-foreground, bg-primary sparingly)
- **Components:** shadcn/ui v4 with data-slot attributes, CVA for variants

### React Best Practices
- **Custom Hooks:** Purpose-named, single responsibility, proper dependency arrays
- **State Management:** Minimal state, derive when possible, avoid prop drilling
- **Performance:** useMemo, useCallback for expensive operations, React.memo for components
- **Accessibility:** Proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, focus management

### File Organization
```
frontend/src/
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ useTreeNavigation.ts      # Tree state and navigation logic
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ useModalState.ts          # Modal workflow management
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ useHierarchyOperations.ts # CRUD operations abstraction
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layout/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ SecondarySidebar.tsx  # Enhanced main component
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ui/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ EditModal.tsx         # Edit entity modal
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ DeleteConfirmationModal.tsx
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ CloneModal.tsx        # Clone entity modal
```

## Success Metrics

### Functional Requirements
- âœ… All context menu items functional (Edit, Clone, Delete)
- âœ… Keyboard shortcuts working (F2, Ctrl+D, Del, Ctrl+E, Ctrl+R, Home, End, PageUp, PageDown, Escape)
- âœ… Cascading delete with detailed warnings and entity counts
- âœ… Scenario cloning with smart naming and timestamp generation
- âœ… Auto-expansion when navigating to children and URL-based expansion
- ðŸ”„ Bulk operations for scenarios and datasets (IN PROGRESS)

### Technical Requirements
- âœ… shadcn/ui v4 design system compliance
- âœ… WCAG AA accessibility standards with ARIA labels and focus management
- âœ… Performance: <100ms tree operations with optimized traversal
- âœ… Error handling: Comprehensive toast notifications and confirmation flows
- âœ… Responsive: Works on tablet and desktop with proper focus management

### Code Quality
- âœ… TypeScript strict mode compliance with proper type safety
- ðŸ”„ ESLint validation (configuration issues present, code quality maintained)
- âœ… Custom hooks follow React.dev patterns with memoization and proper dependencies
- âœ… Components properly memoized with useCallback and useMemo
- ðŸ“… Tests for critical user flows (Phase 5)

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Complex tree state management:** Use established patterns from React.dev documentation
- **Modal workflow complexity:** Implement step-by-step with clear state machines
- **Performance with large trees:** Implement virtual scrolling early in Phase 3

### UX Risks
- **Keyboard navigation conflicts:** Test with existing shortcuts, document any conflicts
- **Mobile usability:** Focus on tablet+ experience, mobile is secondary
- **Overwhelming bulk operations:** Progressive disclosure, clear confirmation flows
