  Claude I'm trying to read some context on React features. I want you to ultra think and review the documentation because we are going to create a new hook, and I'm not exactly sure where the hook should
   be created. So I need you to review the documentation and use your expertise as an architect because I want to achieve the following optimizations

  The text appears to be cut off at the bottom, but this shows someone asking Claude to review the Claude Code hooks documentation to help design a new React hook with specific optimizations in mind. The
  person wants architectural guidance on where to place the hook and how to structure it properly.

  Claude has released the new hooks feature. I want you to ultrathink and review the documentation because we are going to create a new hook, and I'm not exactly sure where the hook should be created. So I need you to review the document and use your expertise as an architect because I want to achieve the following outcomes:

  1. Before we generate any code, I want you to extensively think and review the optimization upgrade flow plan to make sure that we're utilizing the code in my repo. Here is the attached rules files: "C:\projects\vrp-system\v4\docs\04-development\optimisation-case-studies.md"
"C:\projects\vrp-system\v4\docs\04-development\optimisation-principles.md"
"C:\projects\vrp-system\v4\docs\04-development\master-optimization-principles.md" 

  2. I then want you to generate code using the principles.
  3. I want you to review the code and make sure it has met the principles and call out any areas that still need to be optimised.
  4. Lastly, I want you to work through until we have met the optimization principles (Iterate until the optimization goals are met).
