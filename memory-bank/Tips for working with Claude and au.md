Tips for working with Claude and autonomously generated scripts:

Instruct Claude to document any unusual behavior, edge cases, or implementation quirks encountered during script creation. This creates invaluable context for future modifications and debugging sessions.

Keep scripts focused and modular to fit comfortably within Claude's context window.

Design the overall system architecture yourself, then delegate individual script components to Claude. The clearer you define and specify the expected input & output signatures the better.

Instruct Claude to create a guide document for using the bash script (like a CLAUDE.md file). As he tests the script with your prompts, have him iteratively update the guide document based on any issues discovered during actual usage.
